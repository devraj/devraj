# Design and Engineering [@Anomaly](https://github.com/anomaly)

I am software engineer with over 20 years of experience. I've been tinkering with computers sine 1988, when my dad decided to digitise his business after a visit to Japan, where he realised the potenital of what these machines could do. My first go at programming was in the early nineties using a now defunct programming language called [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro). In the mid nineties I rewrote a business management software for my dad's business which is now available on the [Github](https://github.com/devraj/zoom) as relic.

I received my formative education between two highly prestigious schools, [The Scindia School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scindia_School) in Gwalior, India and [The Southport School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport_School) in the Gold Coast, Australia.
Following that I studied computer science at [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au) in [Wagga Wagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia).

After graduating I started Anomaly, a software engineering and design firm where I serve as the principal designer and engineer. We are a massive proponent of the [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) technologies and endeavour to share whatever we can with the world. My current interests are modern Web and iOS design and engineering.

In late 2000s I built [prestans](https://github.com/anomaly/prestans), a Python framework that allowed building APIs (based on REST principles) with features like [payload validation](https://prestans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html), [partial content rendering](https://prestans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handlers.html#minifying-content), attributes that you will find in many modern frameworks. It also featured what we called [Blueprint](https://github.com/anomaly/prestans/issues/92) an idea akin to Swagger. The framework also featured tight integration with [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure) and allowed us to build single page apps before they were the cool thing to do.

Anomaly is boastful of being [Linode](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/linode/) and [Stripe](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/stripe/)'s early partners, advocating the use of the alternative cloud and developer first approach to payments.

Active open source projects include:
- [Gallagher Python Toolkit](https://github.com/anomaly/gallagher), the missing toolkit for extending Gallagher Security's Command Centre, featuring a Python idiomatic client, CLI, TUI and a SQL interface.
- [Anomaly Labs](https://github.com/anomaly/lab-python-server), a set of reference repositories for building Web applications using Python, Postgres and React, and managing infrastructure using Terraform.
- [Wattle](https://github.com/wattlehq), a long term project that I've personally led in the local government space working with a couple of forward thinking councils in the Riverina, NSW, Australia. Last year we decided to democratise software for the local government space by open sourcing the intellectual property.

As part of our Stripe partnership, I am currently working towards achieving various credentials:
