# Design and Engineering [@Anomaly](https://github.com/anomaly), Adjunct Professional, [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au)

I am software engineer with over 20 years of experience. I've been tinkering with computers sine 1988, when my dad decided to digitise his business after a visit to Japan, where he realised the potenital of what these machines could do. My first go at programming was in the early nineties using a now defunct programming language called [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro). In the mid nineties I rewrote a business management software for my dad's business which is now available on the [Github](https://github.com/devraj/zoom) as relic.

I received my formative education between two highly prestigious schools, [The Scindia School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scindia_School) in Gwalior, India and [The Southport School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport_School) in the Gold Coast, Australia.
Following that I studied computer science at [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au) in [Wagga Wagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia).

After graduating I started Anomaly, a software engineering and design firm where I serve as the principle designer and engineer. We are a massive proponent of the [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) technologies and endeavour to share whatever we can with the world. My current interests are modern Web and iOS design and engineering.

In late 2000s I built [prestans](https://github.com/anomaly/prestans), a Python framework that allowed building RESTful APIs with features like [payload validation](https://prestans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html), [partial content rendering](https://prestans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handlers.html#minifying-content), attributes that you will find in many modern frameworks. It also featured what we called [Blueprint](https://github.com/anomaly/prestans/issues/92) an ideal akin to Swagger. The framework also featured tight integration with [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure) and allowed us to build single page apps before they were the cool thing to do.

Anomaly is boastful of being [Linode](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/linode/) and [Stripe](https://www.anomaly.ltd/capabilities/stripe/)'s early partners, advocating the use of the alternative cloud and developer first approach to payments.

Active open source projects include:
- [Anomaly Labs](https://github.com/anomaly), a set of reference repositories for building Web applications using Python, Postgres and React, and managing infrastructure using Terraform.
- [Wattle](https://github.com/wattlehq), a long term project that I've personally led in the local government space working with a couple of forward thinking councils in the Riverina, NSW, Australia. Last year we decided to democratise software for the local government space by open sourcing the intellectual property.
